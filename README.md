# Low-Light-Image-Enhancement-Using-CNN
Developed a novel image enhancement model using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
 and Transformer-based architectures.
 • Achieved effective noise reduction, image brightness improvement, and preservation of image details.
 • Utilized Swin Transformer stems for global semantic information and CNN stems for local feature extraction
 within fusion blocks.
 • Designed the model to adaptively adjust resolution through down-sampling and up-sampling to enhance the
 image structure.
 • Reduced complexity of self-attention calculation through multi-head window-based self-attention layers
